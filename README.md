This is a beginner-friendly SQL project that creates two tables: `Departments` and `Courses`, inserts data into them, and runs a query to list departments that offer more than two courses.

It helps practice:
- Table creation
- Foreign key relationships
- Data insertion
- Aggregation and filtering with `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`


- `schema.sql`: Contains `DROP`, `CREATE TABLE`, and `INSERT` statements for `Departments` and `Courses`.
- `query.sql`: Contains the query to find departments with more than 2 courses.
- `access_control.sql` (optional): Example SQL for `GRANT` statement, not runnable on some platforms.



When you run `query.sql`, the expected output is:
